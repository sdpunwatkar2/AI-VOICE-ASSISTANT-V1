Quick notes:
- If you want strict, low-error STT you must:
  1) Use a high-quality, well-labeled speech dataset (many speakers, accents).
  2) Train or fine-tune a neural ASR model (e.g., Whisper, wav2vec2) on that dataset with early stopping, learning rate schedules, and data augmentation.
  3) Use proper validation and strict metrics (WER) and tune hyperparameters.
- This project gives you the plumbing + a simple intent trainer. Replace the dataset and update train.py for heavy training.
